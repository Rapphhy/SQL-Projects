# SQL-Projects
A collection of SQL projects showcasing advanced queries, data analysis, and real-world datasets. üåü


# Before you begin:

Welcome to this data analysis project! üöÄ This guide will help you set up PostgreSQL, create a database called **finance**, and import the datasets to explore meaningful insights. Follow the steps below to join the adventure!

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Install PostgreSQL üõ†Ô∏è

### Windows:
1. [Download PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) for Windows.
2. Run the installer and follow the prompts.
   - Remember your **username**, **password**, and **port number** during installation (default port: `5432`).
3. Launch **pgAdmin** after installation to manage your database.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up Your Database üéØ

1. Launch your PostgreSQL shell (`psql`) or open **pgAdmin**.
2. Create a new database named **finance**:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE finance;
   ```

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Import the Datasets üìÇ

### Step 1: Download the Files
Make sure you have the following CSV files ready:
- `transactions.csv`
- `payment_details.csv`
- `transaction_request.csv`

### Step 2: Create Tables in PostgreSQL
Use the commands below to create tables and import the data.

#### Create the `transactions` Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE transactions (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    transaction_type INT,
    transaction_date TIMESTAMP,
    client_id INT,
    amount NUMERIC,
    merchant_id INT,
    app_id INT
);
```
#### Import Data:
```sql
\COPY transactions(id, transaction_type, transaction_date, client_id, amount, merchant_id, app_id)
FROM '/path/to/transactions.csv'
DELIMITER ','
CSV HEADER;
```

#### Create the `payment_details` Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE payment_details (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    receipt_no VARCHAR(255),
    acct_open_date DATE
);
```
#### Import Data:
```sql
\COPY payment_details(id, receipt_no, acct_open_date)
FROM '/path/to/payment_details.csv'
DELIMITER ','
CSV HEADER;
```

#### Create the `transaction_request` Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE transaction_request (
    transaction_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    description TEXT
);
```
#### Import Data:
```sql
\COPY transaction_request(transaction_id, description)
FROM '/path/to/transaction_request.csv'
DELIMITER ','
CSV HEADER;
```

Replace `/path/to/` with the actual file paths to your CSV files.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Explore the Data üìä

### Dataset Descriptions:
1. **`transactions` Table**:
   - Records all financial transactions.
   - Key columns:
     - `transaction_type`: Type of transaction (e.g., purchase, transfer).
     - `transaction_date`: When the transaction occurred.
     - `client_id`: The client involved in the transaction.
     - `amount`: The monetary value of the transaction.
     - `merchant_id`: The merchant associated with the transaction.
     - `app_id`: The application used for the transaction.

2. **`payment_details` Table**:
   - Tracks payment information.
   - Key columns:
     - `receipt_no`: Receipt number of the transaction.
     - `acct_open_date`: The account opening date.

3. **`transaction_request` Table**:
   - Captures additional transaction details.
   - Key columns:
     - `description`: Details of the transaction or item.

### Key Notes 
- The **`transactions`** table includes a column named **`app_user`**, which encodes transaction actions using specific numeric values. Below is the breakdown:  
  - `1`: Credit received from **Provider A**.  
  - `3`: Credit received from **Provider B**.  
  - `31`: Debit initiated by the bank based on a user-authorized instruction.  
  - `33`: Debit initiated directly by the user through the app.

- **`transaction_type`** in the **`transactions`** table categorizes transactions into two types:  
  - `1`: **Credits** (inflows of funds).  
  - `2`: **Debits** (outflows of funds).  

### Implementations:
- [**Data Insight and Validation:**](https://github.com/Rapphhy/SQL-Projects/tree/main/Data%20Exploration%20and%20Validation)
This SQL queries is designed to support both data exploration and data quality assurance. These queries provide a foundational understanding of dataset structures while ensuring the integrity of critical data. By combining sample data extraction with data integrity checks, these scripts serve as essential tools for exploratory data analysis and validation.
- [**Monthly Transaction Analysis Query:**](https://github.com/Rapphhy/SQL-Projects/tree/main/Monthly%20Transaction%20Analysis)
This SQL query performs a month-on-month analysis of transaction data from the transactions table. It provides insights into the total number of transactions, total credits, total debits, and the overall transaction amounts for each month.
- [**Client Transaction Details Query:**](https://github.com/Rapphhy/SQL-Projects/tree/main/Specific%20client%20details)
This SQL query retrieves detailed transaction information for a specific client from a financial dataset to provide insights into the client's transactions based on defined criteria.
- [**Provider Analysis Query:**](https://github.com/Rapphhy/SQL-Projects/tree/main/Provider%20Analysis)
This SQL query analyzes transaction contributions from two providers: Provider A and Provider B and provides insights into the performance and contributions of each provider.
- [**Top transacting clients(Q1 2010) Query:**](https://github.com/Rapphhy/SQL-Projects/tree/main/Top%20transacting%20clients)
This SQL query identifies the top 20 clients based on transaction activity during the first quarter of 2010 (January to March).
